# WLST for Sublime Text 2

This add-on adds syntax highlighting and tab/code completion for WLST (.py) scripts. 

## Sublime Text 2 Installation

### With Sublime Package Control

Install [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) to install Sublime Text 2 packages.

Once you have Package Control installed, activate your Command Palette and choose '''Package Control: Install Package'''.

Then search for **"WLST"** and press Enter. In mere moments you'll be up and running with full syntax highlighting and tab completion for WLST. 

**Note:** You will need to explicitly choose the WLST language as .py files will default to python syntax highlighting. To permanently fix this, open 'View Syntax->Open all with current extension as...'->WLST. To change it back when are you using python, just reverse it.
